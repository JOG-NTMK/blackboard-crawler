Forked from https://github.com/nassir90/blackboard-crawler

I just changed to work with LYIT Blackboard.

## Requirements

### Python

If you have pip installed, call `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
If not, install pip and then call it.
If you don't want to use pip, you're smart enough to figure things out.

## CLI Options

Use with the option `-h` or `--help` to view all other available options, or look at the file titled "help" in this repo.

## How do I run it?

`py blackboard-crawler.py [OPTIONS]`
