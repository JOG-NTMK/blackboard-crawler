#1 crawl.py "Produces a 'crawlfile' containing all the files that are to be downloaded"
#2 prompt.py "Asks the user which crawlfile entries they want to download"
#3 download.py "Downloads files as normal"

Ok I'm not going to bother making my own markdown language... crawl.json

```js
{
	"modules" : [
		{
			"name" : "SAMPLE_MODULE",
			"submodules" : [
				{
					"name" : "Week by Week",
					"submodules" : [],
					"files" : [],
					"videos" : []
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

Select Modules To Download, or specify which submodules to download
[ ] Electronics
[ ] Programming

Specify submodules of 'Electronics'

[ ] Announcements
[ ] Video lecutres

.etc

## Caching module list
Modules rarely change so what I should really be doing is caching their links and providing a CLI to update said list.
E.g. Blackboard can be thought of a repository and cache updating as `apt update`.
