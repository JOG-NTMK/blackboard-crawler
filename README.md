## Credits
The login phase, and the panopto video downloading code are not my own work.
These parts were done by [Arch](https://github.com/ArchGryphon9362)

## Requirements

### Python

If you have pip installed, call `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
If not, install pip and then call it.
If you don't want to use pip, you're smart enough to figure things out.

## CLI Options

Use with the option `-h` or `--help` to view all other available options.

## How do I run it?

`py download.py`
