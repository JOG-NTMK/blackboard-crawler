#2 prompt.py "Asks the user which crawlfile entries they want to download"
#3 download.py "Downloads files as normal"

Modules rarely change so what I should really be doing is caching their links and providing a CLI to update said list.
E.g. Blackboard can be thought of a repository and cache updating as `apt update`.
